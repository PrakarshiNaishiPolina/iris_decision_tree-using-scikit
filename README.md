Iris Decision Tree Classifier

This Python script demonstrates how to use a decision tree classifier to classify the Iris dataset. It uses scikit-learn for building and evaluating the model, and pandas for handling data.

Features

Loads the Iris dataset.

Splits data into training and testing sets.

Trains a decision tree classifier on the training set.

Evaluates model performance on the testing set.

Predicts the species of new data.

Dataset Information

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning. It contains 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). Each sample has the following features:

Sepal length

Sepal width

Petal length

Petal width

The target labels correspond to the species:

0: Setosa
1: Versicolor
2: Virginica
